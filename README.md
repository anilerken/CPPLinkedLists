# CPPLinkedLists
This is a linked list practise in C++. There are songs in a linked list, also each song has a linked list of musicians. This is not a project actually, it was a homework. I'm posting this because it can be useful for someone who wants to practise linked lists. To test the functions, you should create main function which I didn't include here.
