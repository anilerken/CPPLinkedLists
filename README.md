# CPPLinkedLists
This is a simulation of a jukebox via linked lists in C++. There are tracks in a linked list, also each track has a linked list of musicians. Functions provide options like adding/removing tracks/musicians and displaying tracks/musician roles etc. To test the functions, you should create your main function which I didn't include here.
